VTK/ and Results/
The results for different mesh sizes are for a simulation time between 29 and 30.
The simulations stoped to converge for different mesh sizes at about the time mentioned above.

VTK_t25/ and Results_t25/
are results for t approx. equals 2
With t=25 a change in vorticity is observable for over all mesh sizes
