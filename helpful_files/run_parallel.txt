Compile with
	mpic++ -o test_mprintf test_mprintf.cpp
run with
	mpirun -np 4 ./test_mprintf
Check in advance if mpirun and mpicc are both mpich by typing
	mpirun -V
and
	mpicc -v
The output should be something like
	mpicc for MPICH version 3.2
	...
and
	some error (no executable provided)

In case that mpirun is openMPI the "mpirun -V" the output looks like
	mpirun (Open MPI) 1.10.2
	...
In this case deinstall openMPI (and reinstall mpich if necessary). Different versions (mpich & openMPI) yield various faults, such as rank 0 and size 1 for all processes (no matter what np is specified).
